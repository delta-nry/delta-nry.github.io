I am a computer engineering student who graduated from the University of British
Columbia. In the past, I worked as a Co-op Software Developer at NetApp, and
held a Junior Software Tester Co-op position at TuGo Insurance. I have also
participated in Google Summer of Code 2015 and developed iOS apps at NextConn
Networks, Inc. and [The Ubyssey](http://ubyssey.ca/).
