I am a computer engineering student studying at the University of British
Columbia. Currently, I am working as a co-op software developer at
NetApp. Some of my past achievements include participating in
Google Summer of Code 2015, my role as an App Developer at
[The Ubyssey](http://ubyssey.ca/), and my co-op internship at
NextConn Networks, Inc.
